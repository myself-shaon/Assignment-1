<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 50px;font-family:Impact,'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;margin: 10px;">Hello there! In the near future, I'm hoping for being a Front-End Web Developer</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;margin: 20px;border: 10px;">I am passionate about creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites that provide a seamless user experience. Currently, I am honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm exploring modern frameworks like React and Vue.js. I love tackling new challenges and constantly strive to learn and improve my coding abilities. My goal is to build websites that not only look great but also function flawlessly, ensuring a positive experience for users. Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase my journey, projects, and the skills I have acquired so far. I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and eager to contribute to innovative web development projects. Feel free to explore my work and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or know more about my journey!</p>
